## Installation
This is the outline for installing this program with the expected hardware configurations. There may be unexpected errors in the system if your hardware is different.

### Installing Windows
1. Install Windows 11 per University standards. It will be helpful to have some level of admin acess to install programs.
    - If creating a local account instead of a university account DO NOT connect to wifi during installation. If you accidentally connect, you can press either Shift+Fn+F10 or press Shift+F10 and type `start ms-cxh:localonly`.

        - Always accept any license during installation when prompted
        - Use all default settings unless stated here
    - NVIDIA Graphics Driver (580.88-quadro-rtx-desktop-notebook-win10-win11-64bit-international-dch-whql.exe)
    - Spinnaker SDK (SpinnakerSDK_FULL_4.0.189_x64.exe)
        - Deselect **Agree to allow analytics..** and select **next**
        - Select **Application Development** and select **next**
        - When finished the **Adapter Config Utility** menu may pop up. You can close this without modifying for right now, this is for GigE cameras
    - Anaconda (Anaconda3-2025.12-2-Windows-x86_64.exe)
    - Labjack (LabJack_2025-05-07.exe)
    - Git (Git-2.53.0.2-64-bit.exe)
    - VLC (vlc-3.0.23-win64.exe)
5. Once all apps are installed, restart computer. You can now unplug the flash drive

### Installing Code
1. In the search bar at the bottom of the screen, search for and select **Anaconda Prompt**
2. The code can be installed in any part of computer but for following this installation, it will be installed in **Documents**
    - `cd Documents`
    - `conda create -n rcp-task-acquisition python=3.10`
    - `conda activate rcp-task-acquisition` - Note: You must run this line each time before launching the program from the command line.
    - `git clone https://github.com/mmt-rcp/rcp_task_acquisition.git`
    - `pip install -e rcp_task_acquisition\`
    - `create-shortcut`
3. The final step in the terminal (`create-shortcut`) creates an icon on the Desktop which can be selected to run the code.
    - Alternatively, to run the program from command line, use `rcp-task-acquisition` (making sure you are in the conda environment)

### First Run Setup
Note- in order to correctly run the program, all hardware must be installed
1. In **Select Protocol** panel select **Update Hardware**
2. Under **In Use** select each camera, assign their correct serial numbers, and select the primary/master camera
3. Select **Save Hardware Settings** and select **Close Hardware Panel**
4. On first run, a folder will be created (RawLocalData) to store logs and session data. This folder will be in "C:\Users\Public\Documents".
